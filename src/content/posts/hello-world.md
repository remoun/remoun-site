This is the inaugural post on remoun.blog. I'm setting this up to document hacks, scripts, and useful things I've figured out over the years.

## What to expect

Mostly technical content:

- Scripts I've written that solved real problems
- Infrastructure patterns that worked (and didn't)
- Tools and workflows I've found useful
- Occasional thoughts on engineering practices

## The stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The source is at [remoun.to/gh](https://remoun.to/gh).

More soon.
