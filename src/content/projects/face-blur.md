A browser-based tool for anonymizing faces in photos. AI-powered detection with manual override controls for precision.

- **Fully client-side** — photos never leave your browser
- **Batch processing** — handle multiple photos at once
- **Smart clustering** — groups the same person across photos
- **Manual controls** — draw, move, and resize blur regions
- **Two blur styles** — Gaussian blur or pixelation
