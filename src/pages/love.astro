    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Remoun!</strong> (they/he 🏳️‍🌈) I'm glad you're here!</p>
    <p>I'm seeking a nesting partner, and am open to more along the way.</p>
    <p>If you think we might be a good match, I'd love to hear from you: <a href="#reach-out">reach out</a>!</p>

  <p class="basics">Mid-30s · Genderfluid (they/he) · Pansexual · Polyamorous · East Bay, CA</p>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I gifted over 12,000 clown noses between 2015-2019, across festivals, parties, commutes, and existing in the world. 🤡

  <h2>🌍 Who I Am</h2>
  
  <p>I grew up in the Middle East in a conservative religious family and have grown into a very different life: out as queer and poly for a decade, genderfluid, and still evolving. I have a 100% success rate toppling dictators (now retired) – one of my better stats! 🤡</p>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li><strong>⭐ Star Trek nerd & professional geek</strong> who frequently thinks about how we get closer to that future. Lately that looks like getting more active with <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> and <a href="https://www.eastbaydsa.org/">East Bay DSA</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>🏕️ Community builder:</strong> I co-organize the <a href="https://www.retreatofintention.com/">Retreat of Intention</a> with some friends. I'm working towards co-buying communal living property with friends in 2026, and welcome all sorts of collaborators on any and all of my projects.</li>
    <li><strong>💼 Work stuff:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/remoun/">Seasoned software engineer</a>. I try not to make that my whole personality.</li>
    <li><strong>🔐 A private person:</strong> I am an open book. You really can ask me anything, and I'll probably answer candidly. I'm also the kind of person who won't put much of that book on social media, or share personal details unless it's need-to-know. Relatedly, one of my work projects was building privacy-preserving digital cash in Signal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>💃 Things I enjoy</h3>
  <ul class="enjoy-list">
    <li><strong>Sci-fi that makes you think:</strong> The Expanse, Babylon 5, For All Mankind, and obviously Star Trek.</li>
    <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Puns, slapstick, dry wit, the absurd; I'm fairly easy to amuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Saying "yes, and!"</strong> to unusual experiences and life in general.</li>
    <li><strong>Community events:</strong> Hikes and other meetups, campouts, and festivals, dances and the occasional play party. I like to socialize in intentional containers.</li>
    <li><strong>Dancing:</strong> Contra, fusion, contact improv. Heading to a dance camp for NYE 2026 followed by a dance retreat in Brazil!</li>
    <li><strong>Giving massages:</strong> With my hands and occasionally my buffer.</li>
    <li><strong>Table-top games:</strong> Board games, some Magic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔄 How I move through the world</h3>
  <p>I oscillate between gregarious and hermit modes over months; both versions are real, and I've learned to ride those waves rather than fight them.</p>
  <p>Currently (end of 2025) in a rebuilding season: working with a good therapist, dancing more, and looking for communal housing to invest in long-term. I bought a house with friends in 2020 and loved it; we had to sell in 2024, and I've been itching to get back to intentional community since.</p>
  <p>I'm a mindful listener and animated speaker. I'm earnestly passionate about things I love. People's stories intrigue and invigorate me.</p>

  <h2>💕 What I'm Looking For</h2>

  <p><strong>🏠 Primary goal:</strong> A <a href="https://www.readyforpolyamory.com/post/kitchen-table-and-parallel-polyamory-part-2-extreme-kitchen-table-1">kitchen table poly</a> nesting partnership. A partner to build a life with, in an intentional community context.</p>
  <p><strong>🌈 Also open to:</strong> The full spectrum, from friendly chats and cuddles to sexy play to co-creating enduring, multifaceted relationships.</p>
  <p>I'm especially drawn to other <strong>community-oriented hedonists</strong> who build intentional containers where intimacy can happen rather than leaving it to chance.</p>

  <p>As you may have guessed, my ideal partner is a curious lifelong learner who finds joy and meaning in continuous personal growth. I dream of bringing out the best in each other for decades and decades.</p>

  <h3>In a partner, I value:</h3>

  <div class="note-box">
    <strong>Calling all nuanced thinkers:</strong> "The ancient oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing." —Socrates
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Curiosity and openness to the unusual</li>
    <li>Love of learning and growth</li>
    <li>Ability to unmask and be real together</li>
    <li>Communication skills and willingness to work through hard stuff</li>
    <li>Some overlap in values around justice, ethics, and how we want the world to be</li>
    <li>Shared interest in community and connection</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>💜 Relationship style notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm polyamorous with some established partners and loverfriends.</li>
    <li>I practice kitchen table poly when possible. I love it when my people like each other!</li>
    <li>I'm looking for something with depth and intention, not casual.</li>
    <li>My top love languages are quality time, physical touch, and acts of service.</li>
    <li>Clothing optional when it's just us at home.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚫 What I'm NOT Looking For</h2>
  <ul class="not-list">
    <li><strong>Monogamy:</strong> I have established partners and that's not changing.</li>
    <li><strong>Long distance:</strong> I want to actually spend time together; not interested in starting something primarily virtual.</li>
    <li><strong>Kids:</strong> Open to having them with the right partner, but not pursuing it. Open to dating people who already have kids.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✨ What Dating Me Is Like</h2>

  <h3>The good stuff</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm a good listener and genuinely curious about your inner world.</li>
    <li>I love to learn and share learning and growth.</li>
    <li>I give excellent massages.</li>
    <li>I'm principled and will walk away from prestige for ethics.</li>
    <li>I like to share! Experiences, laughter, food, ideas, clown noses, etc.</li>
    <li>I crave all things unusual and will probably say yes to your weird idea.</li>
    <li>I want to be your rock while you grow toward your dreams. What can I help you stay inspired to do?</li>
    <li>I want to build you up, emotionally co-regulate with you, and see you thrive. Your joy is my joy.</li>
    <li>Let's achieve some power-couple dreams together!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The honest stuff</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I can go hermit mode for days at a time. This is how I recharge, not a sign something's wrong.</li>
    <li>My texting style is mostly functional, largely arranging face time.</li>
    <li>I'm doing ongoing personal work in therapy around how I show up in relationships.</li>
    <li>I'm a professional geek, which means sometimes I optimize things that maybe don't need optimizing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🌡️ How to read me</h3>
  <div class="read-me-grid">
    <div class="read-me-item">
      <strong>At my best:</strong> Curious, engaged, generous with attention, playful. I light up when given the chance to share something I care about, or when I'm in a comfortable context with people I trust.
    </div>
    <div class="read-me-item">
      <strong>At my worst:</strong> Withdrawn, quiet, may miss cues or seem checked out. I can struggle when I don't understand a problem and run out of tools to try, and sometimes I assume that if <em>I</em> can't solve it, it must be unsolvable.
    </div>
    <div class="read-me-item">
      <strong>What helps me thrive:</strong> Direct communication, time to recharge between social things, enough sleep.
    </div>
    <div class="read-me-item">
      <strong>Signs I'm struggling:</strong> Quieter than usual, shorter responses, hiding/withdrawing. (If you find me, a hug helps.)
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="note-box">
    <strong>A note on communication:</strong> I'm not great at reading social cues and may miss subtext. If something matters to you, tell me explicitly — even if you think it should be obvious. I'd rather you over-communicate than assume I caught it. I'm also a first-gen immigrant, so occasionally cultural context gets lost.

  <h2>💬 Why you should date Remoun</h2>
  <p class="testimonial-intro">from people who know them</p>

    <p>Remoun is eminently loveable. They absorb snuggles and compliments like a delicious tiramisu, and give generously as well. They are cute and delightful! Remoun is very aware of their mental and emotional process, and approaches all situations, even difficult ones, with compassion. This is something you can always count on them for. Sometimes Remoun hides when they're sad. You should find them and give them a hug! :)</p>
