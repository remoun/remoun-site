<Love title="Date Me | Remoun">
  <div class="intro">
    <p class="intro-greeting">Hi, I'm</p>
    <h1>Remoun</h1>
    <p class="intro-tagline">Looking for connection, adventure, and someone to share good food with</p>
    <p class="basics">35 · Bay Area · Polyamorous · He/They</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
  <p>
    Software engineer by trade, community builder by choice. I've spent 15 years at places like Google, Waymo, and Kiva 
    because I like working on things that matter. Outside of work, I co-organize an intentional community retreat and 
    sing in a choir.

  <div class="fun-fact">
    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I was an ACM ICPC World Finalist and also minored in Theatre. 
    I contain multitudes. <span class="emoji">🎭</span>
  </div>

  <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connection style:</strong> I gravitate toward depth over breadth. I'd rather have one long conversation than five short ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Relationship structure:</strong> Polyamorous, practicing relationship anarchy. I have existing partners and am open to new connections at various levels of entanglement.</li>
      <li><strong>Ideal date:</strong> Something that lets us actually talk — a long walk, a meal, a museum. Bonus points if we can cook together.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Some Things I'm Into</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dancing:</strong> Partner dance, especially blues and fusion</li>
      <li><strong>Food:</strong> Cooking, exploring restaurants, fermentation experiments</li>
      <li><strong>Ideas:</strong> Systems thinking, how communities form, the intersection of tech and society</li>
      <li><strong>Media:</strong> Sci-fi (The Expanse, For All Mankind), documentary deep dives</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
