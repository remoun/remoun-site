    This is my "serious mode." It's the part of me that is deeply principled, analytical, and perhaps a bit intense when it comes to justice and building a better world. It's the "professional geek" who optimizes for ethics and doesn't mind being the one to point out the uncomfortable truth.
  </div>

  <div class="vibe-note">
    <div class="quote-line rainbow-text">rainbow clown energy on the contra dance floor. 🌈🤡</div>
    This is my "play mode." It's the part of me that gifted 12,000 clown noses, loves puns, and finds pure joy in the absurd and the community of the dance floor. It's about saying "yes, and!" to life and not taking myself too seriously once the "work" is done.
  </div>

  <div class="switcher-note" id="vibe-check">
    **The Switcher:** I oscillate between these modes. Sometimes I'm the intense organizer, sometimes I'm the silly dancer. Both are real, and I'm looking for someone who enjoys the full spectrum of that oscillation.

<div class="note-box">
  <p>I'm here for the long game: finding someone to build a life with. Not rushing it, but genuinely excited for all of it—the butterflies and the boring Tuesdays, the inside jokes that take years to develop, and whatever storms we weather together.</p>
  <p>**Wanted:** Partner(s) in shenanigans.<br/>
  **Shenanigans to include:** lots of puns, cozy nights in, and spontaneous adventures.</p>
  <p>I want to do a lot for my chosen family and for the world. I'd love to do it alongside you. Sound good? Keep reading.</p>

<div class="fun-fact note-box">
  **Fun fact:** I gifted over 12,000 clown noses between 2015-2019, across festivals, parties, commutes, and existing in the world. 🤡

<h2 id="who-i-am">🌍 Who I Am</h2>

### 📋 The Basics

- Mid-30s
- 6'1"
- Genderfluid (they/he); [BSRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bem_Sex-Role_Inventory): Masc 4.6, Fem 5.8
- Pansexual; [Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale): 2.4
- Polyamorous
- East Bay, CA
- **AuDHD** (while the disorder framing can be overly pathologizing, I find it a useful umbrella term, like _queer_)

### 🪧 Core Values

- **Love**
- **Integrity** over reputation, rooted in honesty
- **Agency**, through clarity and autonomy (valuing independence over merged codependency)
- **Curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness**
- **Progress** over perfection
- **Liberation and Empowerment** for all
- **Laughter**

### 🧩 A Few Facets

<div class="content-block">
  I grew up in the Middle East in a conservative religious family and have grown into a very different life: out as queer and poly for a decade, genderfluid, and still evolving. I have a 100% success rate toppling dictators (I was part of the 2011 Egyptian revolution) – one of my better stats! 🤡
</div>

- **⭐ Star Trek nerd & professional geek** who frequently thinks about how we get closer to that future. Lately that looks like getting more active with <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> and <a href="https://www.eastbaydsa.org/">East Bay DSA</a>.
- **🏕️ Community builder:** I co-organize the <a href="https://www.retreatofintention.com/">Retreat of Intention</a> with some friends. I'm working towards co-buying communal living property with friends in 2026, and I love co-creating with friends on all sorts of projects.
- **💼 Work stuff:** <a href="https://remoun.me/resume">Seasoned software engineer</a>. I try not to make that my whole personality.
- **🔐 A private person:** I am a fairly open book. You really can ask me anything, and I'll probably answer candidly. I'm also the kind of person who won't put much of that book on social media, or share personal details unless it's need-to-know.

### 💃 Things I enjoy

<div class="enjoy-grid">
- **Sci-fi that makes you think:** For All Mankind, The Expanse, Babylon 5, and of course Star Trek.
- **Humor:** Puns, slapstick, dry wit, the absurd; I'm fairly easy to amuse.
- **Saying "yes, and!"** to unusual experiences and life in general.
- **Community events:** Hikes and other meetups, campouts, and festivals, dances and the occasional play party. I like to socialize in intentional containers.
- **Reading:** I'm a fan of books, articles, essays, etc. that make me think and help me see the world more accurately.
- **Singing:** Karaoke, community choirs, sometimes at marches.
- **Dancing:** Contra, fusion, contact improv. Heading to a dance camp for NYE 2026 followed by a dance retreat in Brazil!
- **Giving massages:** With my hands and occasionally my buffer.
- **Table-top games:** Board games, some Magic.
</div>

### 🔄 How I move through the world

<div class="content-block">
  I oscillate between gregarious and hermit modes over months; I'm a mindful listener and animated speaker, and I've learned to ride those waves rather than fight them.

  Currently (early 2026) in a rebuilding season: working towards a promotion, dancing more, and looking for communal housing to invest in long-term.

  **A note on communication:** I'm not the best at reading social cues and may miss subtext. If something matters to you, tell me explicitly. I'm also a first-gen immigrant, so occasionally cultural context gets lost.
</div>

<h2 id="life-design">🏡 Life Design & The Dream</h2>

<div class="content-block">
  <p><strong>The dream:</strong> home bases in the Bay Area and Europe (probably Malta), with regular visits to Egypt, Thailand, and wherever else calls.</p>
  
  <p><strong>On kids:</strong> If I'm going to be a parent, I want more than one kid — I love the idea of siblings growing up together. So it's either 0 or 2+ kids for me. Either we're raising multilingual siblings across continents, or we're the cool aunt and uncle with a guest room in every time zone.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-im-looking-for">💕 What I'm Looking For</h2>

<div class="note-box">
  **🏠 Long-term Intentions:** A [kitchen table poly](https://www.readyforpolyamory.com/post/kitchen-table-and-parallel-polyamory-part-2-extreme-kitchen-table-1) nesting partnership. A partner to grow a family with, in an intentional community context.
</div>

<div class="note-box">
  **👶 Parenting:** I want to be a parent, ideally with my nesting partner. Open to partners who already have kids — and if I'm helping raise children, I'd like at least one to be my biological child.
</div>

<div id="casual-shenanigans" class="content-block note-box casual-note">
  **🌈 Also open to:** everything from cozy hangouts to deep intimacy to building something lasting.

  I'm especially drawn to other **community-oriented hedonists** who build intentional containers where connection can happen rather than leaving it to chance.
</div>

### 💎 In a partner, I value:

- Curiosity and openness to the unusual
- Love of learning and growth
- Ability to unmask and be real together
- Communication skills and willingness to work through hard stuff
- Some overlap in values around justice, ethics, and how we want the world to be
- Shared interest in community and connection

### 💜 Relationship style notes:

- I practice kitchen table poly when possible. I love it when my people like each other!
- I'm mostly looking for a nesting partner (AKA "primary", but I'm generally non-hierarchical), but would start any relationship casually to see if we get along as friends first.
- **I really value stable connection, which takes many forms:** hedonistic sex, intimate friendship, comets, primaries, and nesting partners.
- **I do better when those I love keep a good portion of their own independence**, with other forms of complementary support, rather than searching for merged codependency.
- **I travel a fair bit, recenter in solitude, and can be project obsessed**, therefore connection with me needs to be robust to that reality.
- My top love languages are physical touch, quality time, and acts of service.
- Clothing optional when it's just us at home.

## 🚫 What I'm NOT Looking For

<div class="note-box">
  **Monogamy?! In this economy?!** 📉
</div>

- **Monogamy:** I have established partners and that's not changing.
- **Long distance:** Not interested in dating people outside the SF Bay Area.

<div class="note-box casual-note">
  **Shorter-term and/or more casual:** I'm also open to "less serious" dating, and don't need as much alignment with people I date more casually. Just communicate about what sort(s) of relationships you want, if you know.
</div>

## ✨ What Dating Me Is Like

### 🌟 The good stuff

- I'm a good listener and genuinely curious about your inner world.
- I love to learn and share learning and growth.
- I give excellent massages.
- I'm principled and will walk away from prestige for ethics.
- I love to share! Experiences, laughter, food, ideas, clown noses, orgasms, etc.
- I want to build you up, emotionally co-regulate with you, and be your rock while you see you thrive.
- I'm available for "analytical coach" energy — I love helping partners debug their lives, optimize their systems, or think through complex challenges.

### 🤔 The honest stuff

- I can go hermit mode for days at a time. This is how I recharge.
- My texting style is mostly functional, largely arranging face time.
- I'm doing ongoing personal work in therapy.
- I'm a professional geek, which means I optimize things, sometimes beyond what is necessary.

### 🌡️ How to read me

<div class="read-me-grid">
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **At my best:** Curious, engaged, generous with attention, playful. I light up when given the chance to share something I care about.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **At my worst:** Withdrawn, quiet, may miss cues or seem checked out. I can struggle when I don't understand a problem.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **What helps me thrive:** Direct communication, time to recharge, enough sleep.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **Signs I'm struggling:** Quieter than usual, shorter responses, hiding/withdrawing. (If you find me, a hug helps.)
  </div>

## 💬 Why you might want to date Remoun

<p class="testimonial-intro">from people who know them</p>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>_I've known them for almost two decades, across different phases of life, environments, and versions of ourselves. These observations come from long-term, consistent knowing rather than a single context._</p>
  <p>**At their best:** They are calm, attentive, and deeply present. They listen with the intent to understand, not to respond or correct, and they make space for complexity without rushing it into something neat. They are thoughtful in a way that feels lived-in rather than theoretical: curious, principled, and emotionally steady. When they are resourced, they show up with clarity and kindness at the same time, able to hold boundaries without shutting people out. They have a way of making others feel seen and safe without centering themselves.</p>
  <p>**Conditions where they show up really well:** They thrive in environments that allow for depth, nuance, and honest conversation. One-on-one or small, intentional settings suit them best, especially when there is mutual respect, intellectual curiosity, and emotional safety. They do well when there is enough time, low noise (literal and emotional), and when expectations are clear. When they feel trusted and unpressured, their insight, humor, and care come through naturally.</p>
  <p>**At their worst or signs they are struggling:** When they are tired or overstimulated, they tend to withdraw rather than act out. They may become quieter, more contained, or harder to read, conserving energy instead of engaging. There is often a noticeable reduction in spontaneity or warmth, not from lack of care but from overload. In those moments, they may default to practicality or distance as a form of self-protection. They do not lash out; they go inward.</p>
  <p>**Overall pattern:** They are someone who shows up best when there is mutual consideration and space to be human. Stress does not make them unkind; it makes them less visible. When supported, they are grounding, emotionally intelligent, and quietly transformative to the people around them.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Nefertiti</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Over the course of our friendship, you have introduced me to a very large number of deeply important and memorable experiences and people.</p>
  <p>And I would say that you are like a magical fairy that brings me awesome treats in the form of things I want in my life, like awesome people and experiences.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Maja C</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Remoun is a playful person with incredible dedication to community and personal growth. They are open-minded and love to explore the world through travel, new connections, and deep intimacy. I've seen Remoun build new practices in dance and facilitation with an amazing consistency even in the face of big challenges. I think Remoun's curiosity and dedication are their best qualities.</p>
  <p>Remoun at their best is welcoming, gentle, and deeply present. When Remoun is struggling, they become depressed, introverted, and sluggish.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Starfox</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>I met Remoun at a 3-day community event called Retreat of Intention. I was drawn to their openness, gentleness, and warmth. They showed up with a tenderness and authenticity that instantly made me feel comfortable connecting with them. We shared some deep, vulnerable truths with each other and formed a sweet friendship of shared values and mutual desire for growth.</p>
  <p>I've experienced Remoun's excellent communication and group facilitation skills. Friends and community are extremely important to them. They are genuinely fun to hang out with and have a generous heart, welcoming others into group situations seamlessly.</p>
  <p>At their best, they're vibrant, clear, playful, and open to trying new things. At their worst, they become secluded, withdrawn, and self-critical. I think they would benefit from a partner that can see the best in them, even when they can't see it themself.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Cindy R</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Remoun is eminently loveable. They absorb snuggles and compliments like a delicious tiramisu, and give generously as well. They are cute and delightful! Remoun is very aware of their mental and emotional process, and approaches all situations, even difficult ones, with compassion. This is something you can always count on them for. Sometimes Remoun hides when they're sad. You should find them and give them a hug! :)</p>
