<h2 id="who-i-am">🌍 Who I Am</h2>

### 📋 The Basics

- Mid-30s
- 6'1"
- Genderfluid (they/he); [BSRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bem_Sex-Role_Inventory): Masc 4.6, Fem 5.8
- Pansexual; [Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale): 2.4
- Polyamorous
- East Bay, CA
- **AuDHD** (while the disorder framing can be overly pathologizing, I find it a useful umbrella term, like _queer_)

### 🪧 Core Values

- **Love**
- **Integrity** over reputation, rooted in honesty
- **Agency**, through clarity and autonomy
- **Curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness**
- **Progress** over perfection
- **Liberation and Empowerment** for all
- **Laughter**

### 🧩 A Few Facets

<div class="content-block">
  I grew up in the Middle East in a conservative religious family and have grown into a very different life: out as queer and poly for a decade, genderfluid, and still evolving. I have a 100% success rate toppling dictators (now retired) – one of my better stats! 🤡
</div>

- **⭐ Star Trek nerd & professional geek** who frequently thinks about how we get closer to that future. Lately that looks like getting more active with <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> and <a href="https://www.eastbaydsa.org/">East Bay DSA</a>.
- **🏕️ Community builder:** I co-organize the <a href="https://www.retreatofintention.com/">Retreat of Intention</a> with some friends. I'm working towards co-buying communal living property with friends in 2026, and welcome all sorts of collaborators on any and all of my projects.
- **💼 Work stuff:** <a href="https://remoun.me/resume">Seasoned software engineer</a>. I try not to make that my whole personality.
- **🔐 A private person:** I am an open book. You really can ask me anything, and I'll probably answer candidly. I'm also the kind of person who won't put much of that book on social media, or share personal details unless it's need-to-know. Relatedly, one of my work projects was building privacy-first digital cash in Signal.

<div class="photo-placeholder" data-caption="Values in action: community & outdoors"></div>

### 💃 Things I enjoy

<div class="enjoy-grid">
- **Sci-fi that makes you think:** The Expanse, Babylon 5, For All Mankind, and obviously Star Trek.
- **Humor:** Puns, slapstick, dry wit, the absurd; I'm fairly easy to amuse.
- **Saying "yes, and!"** to unusual experiences and life in general.
- **Community events:** Hikes and other meetups, campouts, and festivals, dances and the occasional play party. I like to socialize in intentional containers.
- **Reading:** I'm a fan of books, articles, essays, etc. that make me think and help me see the world more accurately.
- **Singing:** Karaoke and some community choirs.
- **Dancing:** Contra, fusion, contact improv. Heading to a dance camp for NYE 2026 followed by a dance retreat in Brazil!
- **Giving massages:** With my hands and occasionally my buffer.
- **Table-top games:** Board games, some Magic.
</div>

### 🔄 How I move through the world

<div class="content-block">
  I oscillate between gregarious and hermit modes over months; both versions are real, and I've learned to ride those waves rather than fight them.

  Currently (early 2026) in a rebuilding season: working with a good therapist, dancing more, and looking for communal housing to invest in long-term. I bought a house with friends in 2020 and loved it; we had to sell in 2024, and I've been wanting to get back to intentional community since.

  I'm a mindful listener and animated speaker. I'm earnestly passionate about things I love. People's stories intrigue and invigorate me.
</div>

<div class="photo-placeholder" data-caption="Casual & cozy at home"></div>

<h2 id="what-im-looking-for">💕 What I'm Looking For</h2>

<div class="note-box">
  **🏠 Primary goal:** A [kitchen table poly](https://www.readyforpolyamory.com/post/kitchen-table-and-parallel-polyamory-part-2-extreme-kitchen-table-1) nesting partnership. A partner to grow a family with, in an intentional community context.
</div>

<div class="note-box">
  **👶 Parenting:** I want to be a parent, ideally with my nesting partner. Open to partners who already have kids — and if I'm helping raise children, I'd like at least one to be my biological child.
</div>

<div class="content-block note-box casual-note">
  **🌈 Also open to:** The full spectrum, from friendly chats and cuddles to sexy play to co-creating enduring, multifaceted relationships.

  I'm especially drawn to other **community-oriented hedonists** who build intentional containers where connection can happen rather than leaving it to chance.

  As you may have guessed, my ideal partner is a curious lifelong learner who finds joy and meaning in continuous personal growth. I dream of bringing out the best in each other for decades and decades.
</div>

### 💎 In a partner, I value:

<div class="note-box">
  **Calling all nuanced thinkers:** "The ancient oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing." —Socrates
</div>

- Curiosity and openness to the unusual
- Love of learning and growth
- Ability to unmask and be real together
- Communication skills and willingness to work through hard stuff
- Some overlap in values around justice, ethics, and how we want the world to be
- Shared interest in community and connection

### 💜 Relationship style notes:

- I'm polyamorous with some established partners and loverfriends.
- I practice kitchen table poly when possible. I love it when my people like each other!
- I'm mostly looking for a nesting partner (AKA "primary", but I'm generally non-hierarchical), but would start any relationship casually to see if we get along as friends first.
- My top love languages are physical touch, quality time, acts of service, and [sharing memes](https://betches.com/idgaf-about-words-of-affirmation-here-are-the-5-meme-love-languages/).
- Clothing optional when it's just us at home.

## 🚫 What I'm NOT Looking For

- **Monogamy:** I have established partners and that's not changing.
- **Long distance:** Not interested in dating people outside the SF Bay Area.

<div class="note-box casual-note">
  **Shorter-term and/or more casual:** I'm also open to "less serious" dating, and don't need as much alignment with people I date more casually. Just communicate about what sort(s) of relationships you want, if you know.
</div>

## ✨ What Dating Me Is Like

### 🌟 The good stuff

- I'm a good listener and genuinely curious about your inner world.
- I love to learn and share learning and growth.
- I give excellent massages.
- I'm principled and will walk away from prestige for ethics.
- I like to share! Experiences, laughter, food, ideas, clown noses, etc.
- I crave all things unusual and will probably say yes to your weird idea.
- I want to be your rock while you grow toward your dreams.
- I want to build you up, emotionally co-regulate with you, and see you thrive.

### 🤔 The honest stuff

- I can go hermit mode for days at a time. This is how I recharge.
- My texting style is mostly functional, largely arranging face time.
- I'm doing ongoing personal work in therapy.
- I'm a professional geek, which means I optimize things.

### 🌡️ How to read me

<div class="read-me-grid">
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **At my best:** Curious, engaged, generous with attention, playful. I light up when given the chance to share something I care about.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **At my worst:** Withdrawn, quiet, may miss cues or seem checked out. I can struggle when I don't understand a problem.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **What helps me thrive:** Direct communication, time to recharge, enough sleep.
  </div>
  <div class="read-me-item">
    **Signs I'm struggling:** Quieter than usual, shorter responses, hiding/withdrawing. (If you find me, a hug helps.)
  </div>
</div>

<div class="note-box">
  **A note on communication:** I'm not the best at reading social cues and may miss subtext. If something matters to you, tell me explicitly. I'm also a first-gen immigrant, so occasionally cultural context gets lost.
</div>

## 💬 Why you might want to date Remoun

<p class="testimonial-intro">from people who know them</p>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>_I've known them for almost two decades, across different phases of life, environments, and versions of ourselves. These observations come from long-term, consistent knowing rather than a single context._</p>
  <p>**At their best:** They are calm, attentive, and deeply present. They listen with the intent to understand, not to respond or correct, and they make space for complexity without rushing it into something neat. They are thoughtful in a way that feels lived-in rather than theoretical: curious, principled, and emotionally steady. When they are resourced, they show up with clarity and kindness at the same time, able to hold boundaries without shutting people out. They have a way of making others feel seen and safe without centering themselves.</p>
  <p>**Conditions where they show up really well:** They thrive in environments that allow for depth, nuance, and honest conversation. One-on-one or small, intentional settings suit them best, especially when there is mutual respect, intellectual curiosity, and emotional safety. They do well when there is enough time, low noise (literal and emotional), and when expectations are clear. When they feel trusted and unpressured, their insight, humor, and care come through naturally.</p>
  <p>**At their worst or signs they are struggling:** When they are tired or overstimulated, they tend to withdraw rather than act out. They may become quieter, more contained, or harder to read, conserving energy instead of engaging. There is often a noticeable reduction in spontaneity or warmth, not from lack of care but from overload. In those moments, they may default to practicality or distance as a form of self-protection. They do not lash out; they go inward.</p>
  <p>**Overall pattern:** They are someone who shows up best when there is mutual consideration and space to be human. Stress does not make them unkind; it makes them less visible. When supported, they are grounding, emotionally intelligent, and quietly transformative to the people around them.</p>

</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Over the course of our friendship, you have introduced me to a very large number of deeply important and memorable experiences and people.</p>
  <p>And I would say that you are like a magical fairy that brings me awesome treats in the form of things I want in my life, like awesome people and experiences.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Maja C</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Remoun is a playful person with incredible dedication to community and personal growth. They are open-minded and love to explore the world through travel, new connections, and deep intimacy. I've seen Remoun build new practices in dance and facilitation with an amazing consistency even in the face of big challenges. I think Remoun's curiosity and dedication are their best qualities.</p>
  <p>Remoun at their best is welcoming, gentle, and deeply present. When Remoun is struggling, they become depressed, introverted, and sluggish.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Starfox</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>I met Remoun at a 3-day community event called Retreat of Intention. I was drawn to their openness, gentleness, and warmth. They showed up with a tenderness and authenticity that instantly made me feel comfortable connecting with them. We shared some deep, vulnerable truths with each other and formed a sweet friendship of shared values and mutual desire for growth.</p>
  <p>I've experienced Remoun's excellent communication and group facilitation skills. Friends and community are extremely important to them. They are genuinely fun to hang out with and have a generous heart, welcoming others into group situations seamlessly.</p>
  <p>At their best, they're vibrant, clear, playful, and open to trying new things. At their worst, they become secluded, withdrawn, and self-critical. I think they would benefit from a partner that can see the best in them, even when they can't see it themself.</p>
  <p class="testimonial-author">Cindy R</p>
</div>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>Remoun is eminently loveable. They absorb snuggles and compliments like a delicious tiramisu, and give generously as well. They are cute and delightful! Remoun is very aware of their mental and emotional process, and approaches all situations, even difficult ones, with compassion. This is something you can always count on them for. Sometimes Remoun hides when they're sad. You should find them and give them a hug! :)</p>
